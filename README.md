# Strategy-backtest-on-tick-data

In this repository, a trading strategy based on the timeseries of 2 stocks is implemented. 
The timeseries are first cleaned and analyzed, with computation of correlation after some resampling.
A simple strategy is backtested to take andvantage of a possible lag between the stocks' moves on the two different exchanges.

The exercise is of educational nature and does not represent a real market scenario. The analysis and results are purely theoretical.
